# hello-world
My first repository

Hi GitHub.

This is my first using this software. however, I am very excited to explore the possibilites presented in this web-based system and to collaborate with others on this site. 

I attend Jacksonville University located in Jacksonville University where I am pursuing a B.A. in Political Science and a B.S. in Geography. 

Currently I am enrolled in a Coursera course about Data Science offered by Johns Hopkins, the reason I created a GitHub account.
